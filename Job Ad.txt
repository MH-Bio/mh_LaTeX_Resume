Job Description	The company is deploying IoT products that utilize IoT and machine learning technologies to aquaculture sites around the world. By installing IoT devices in actual sea or ponds, users (aquaculture farmers) can remotely control , feed and monitor fishes in real time via cameras in the IoT devices. The feeding can also be automatically controlled by machine learning based on the video/images acquired from the camera. We will develop and operate such IoT products to help solve problems in aquaculture.

This role will be based in Singapore and Japan. However, starting via remote work is also acceptable, and relocation support is available if you need to move to Singapore or Japan.

[ Scope of work ]
1. Develop functions for IoT products, which consist of IoT devices, web services and mobile applications for users to operate them. Based on customer requests and feedback, make IoT devices more convenient and easier to use. Also add functions to IoT products to solve potential problems discovered in the aquaculture field so that farmers can use IoT products in new ways.

2. Build / develop / operate device software and infrastructure to ensure stable use of IoT products by users. Continuously acquire and monitor data to keep stable operation of IoT devices in real-world environments. Design the infrastructure to ensure stable remote control even in unstable network environments such as on the ocean. Also build / develop / operate a deployment system to quickly provide newly developed functions to users.

3. Develop functions to enable efficient feeding to improve the growth of aquaculture seafoods. Analyze data acquired from IoT devices to find current issues, and implement functions in IoT products to support users' research on feeding methods using the data.

4. Use company's IoT technology and IoT products for research and development with public sector and enterprise companies to develop solutions that solve aquaculture issues and environmental problems. The results developed in this way will be implemented as functions of company's IoT products and provided as services.
